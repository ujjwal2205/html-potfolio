<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a second-year B.Tech student at a government university, passionate about technology and software development. My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer, and I've already started my journey by learning Java. I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, with the aim of creating dynamic and efficient web applications.</p>
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, working on personal projects, and constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in the world of development.
